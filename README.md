Project Title:
Exploring and identifying potential healthcare holes in Victoria

Project Description:
This project investigates the relationship between the growing Victorian population and the various health services available to its people. Access to tertiary and primary healthcare facilities are considered and corresponding health outcomes and mortality rates are explored. 
The focus of this project is Victoria, Australia and the datasets analysed are from the years 2016 - 2022. Major sources of the datasets are the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and the Australian Institue of Health and Welfare (AIHW). Additionally, GeoAPIfy is used for querying geo-cordinates of the various hospitals and Local Government Areas (LAGs) for the analysis.

Research Question 1 (Shelly Wong):
Identify areas of population growth in Victoria and understand the health services available to the areas

# Please add your data analysis here which contains "ample and complete" information. This is a requirement of GitHub.

Research Question 2 (Richard Thornton):
Determine the the available health services in Victoria - tertiary hospitals and primary healthcare services providers (general practicioners and pharmacies)

# Please add your data analysis here which contains "ample and complete" information. This is a requirement of GitHub.

Research Question 3 (Pedro Azpurua):
Compare patient wait times at hospitals and the population growth. Furthermore, perform hypothesis testing on the datasets to support any findings

# Please add your data analysis here which contains "ample and complete" information. This is a requirement of GitHub.

Research Question 4 (Jalaj Sharma):
Compare the mortality rate (age-standardised adult deaths per 100,000) and access to hospitals of the LGAs in Victoria

# Please add your data analysis here which contains "ample and complete" information. This is a requirement of GitHub.

Research Question 5 (Shelly Wong, Shrushti Shah):
Identify the areas where healthcare services are lacking and therefore a need for healthcare services exists, especially for population dense Victorians in the >70 years old age bracket

# Please add your data analysis here which contains "ample and complete" information. This is a requirement of GitHub.

Conclusion (Shrushti Shah):
